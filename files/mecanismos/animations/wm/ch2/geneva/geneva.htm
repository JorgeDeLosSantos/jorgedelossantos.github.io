<p ALIGN="left">A Geneva mechanism converts the motion of a continuous rotating crank
to a intermittent motion of the Geneva wheel. For a four-slot wheel, the Geneva wheel rotates 90 degrees for a complete rotation of a
crank.</p>

      <p ALIGN="left">The mechanism was originally invented to prevent over-winding 
        a watch spring. The watch spring was wound by the shaft attached to the 
        Geneva wheel and the winding handle was fixed to the other shaft. When 
        the designers omitted one of the slots they restricted the number of turns, 
        through which the winding handle could be turned, thus protecting the 
        spring. The mechanism is now used&nbsp; for indexing purposes.<O:P> For 
        example, indexing of a turret of an automated lathe, an automatic tool 
        changer in a milling machine, or&nbsp; to move the film on one frame at 
        a time in film projectors.&nbsp;</p>
