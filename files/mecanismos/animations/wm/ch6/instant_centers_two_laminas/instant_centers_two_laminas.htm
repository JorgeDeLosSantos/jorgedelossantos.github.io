      <p ALIGN="left">An instant center is a point common to two links which has
      the same velocity. The instant center I<sub>24</sub> is a point that
      common to both links 2 and 4 at the instant.&nbsp;</p>

      <p ALIGN="left">In this simulation file,&nbsp; I<sub>24</sub>  is
      separately attached to link 2
      and link 4, forming two separate triangles. As the linkage moves from that instant,
      these two points (and two triangles) separate and their velocities differ.
      Only when
      these two points coincide, their velocity vectors are the same.&nbsp;</p>
