      <p align="left">The input gear (in blue) is connected to the drive shaft.
      It drives the ring gear (in dark green, a large bevel gear). Note that the
      carrier (in dark
      green), where planetary gears (in yellow) are mounted,&nbsp; is rigidly
      connected to the ring gear. The planet gears drive the two side bevel
      gears and shafts (in light green.)</p>

      <p align="left">In the first simulation, the vehicle is moving straight
      ahead, and the two wheels are turning at the same speed. The ring gear and
      two side gears are turning at the same speed. Note that planet gears are
      not spinning.&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left">In the second simulation, the right axle is stationary, as
      in the case when the right wheel is on a patch of ice and loses traction.
      The left shaft is then turning twice the normal speed, as it receives the
      entire power from the drive train. Note that planet gears are spinning.&nbsp;</p>

        gear train, click <a href="differential.pdf">here</a>.</p>
