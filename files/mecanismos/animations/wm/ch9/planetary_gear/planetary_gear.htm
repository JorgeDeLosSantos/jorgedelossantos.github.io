      <p align="left"> The planetary system is coaxial and is particularly
      suitable for high torque low speed applications. The planetary gear
      system is very compact. Depending upon type and
      size planetary units offer single stage reduction from 3:1 to 10:1, with
      multi-stage ratios is excess of 10,000:1.</p>

      <p align="left"> The gear-train is a two-degrees-of-freedom mechanism. In
      the Working Model 2D file,&nbsp; the input velocity of the arm and sun gear 
      can be changed using
      the slide bars or just enter the value in the box.</p>
