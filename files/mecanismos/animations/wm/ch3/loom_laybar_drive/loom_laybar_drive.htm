      <p align="left">A weaving loom is an apparatus for making thread into
      cloth by weaving strands together at right angles. Warp threads run
      lengthwise, and woof threads run crosswise in a woven fabric.</p>

      <p align="left">During weaving, every other warp thread is raised up and the alternate ones pulled
      down to create a &quot;tunnel&quot; if observed from the edge of the
      cloth. A shuttle, which looks like a
      miniature canoe, contains a bobbin of woof thread within it, is
      &quot;thrown&quot; through the tunnel.</p>

      <p align="left">The laybar (in red) carries a comb-like device
      called a reed (in black). The teeth of this reed-comb separate the warp threads and
      push the new woof thread sideways into the previous
      ones to &quot;beat-up&quot; the cloth and create a tight weave.</p>
