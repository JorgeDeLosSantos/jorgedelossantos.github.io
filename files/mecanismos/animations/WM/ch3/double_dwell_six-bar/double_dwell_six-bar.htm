The output link (in white) remains stationary briefly in the beginning and end 
of the simulation. The coupler point on the coupler link (in yellow) of the 
fourbar linkage (in red and yellow) traces a curve containing two approximate 
straight-line segments. The coupler point is connected to a slider (in black), 
sliding on a pivoted track (in white), with the pivot located at the 
intersection of the straight-line segments. </p>
      <p>
When the block moves in this straight-line segments, the output link remains 
stationary.</p>
