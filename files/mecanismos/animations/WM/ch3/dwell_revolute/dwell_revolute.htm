<p>
The output link (in blue), a rocker, remains stationary briefly in the beginning 
of the simulation. The coupler point on the coupler link (in black) of the 
fourbar linkage (in red and black) traces a curve containing an approximate 
circular arc. As the connecting link (in green) moves in this segment, the lower 
point of the link remain approximately stationary (as it is at the center of the 
circular arc), and therefore the rocker remains stationary.</p>
