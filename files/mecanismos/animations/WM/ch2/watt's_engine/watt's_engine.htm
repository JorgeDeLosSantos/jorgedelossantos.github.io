      <h3><a name="info">Info</a></h3>

      <p>In 1784, James Watt designed this steam engine to produce power directly 
        on a shaft (in gray). At the time there were no means available for machining 
        crosshead guides that would accurately constrain the piston to move in&nbsp;a 
        straight line. The ingenious <a href="../../ch3/watt/watt.htm" target="_parent">Watt's 
        linkage</a> is a straight line mechanism developed to circumvent this 
        difficulty. The double acting cylinder has a bore diameter of 19 inches 
        with a 4 ft stroke. With the output link and gears included, the six-bar 
        linkage is categorized as the <a href="../watt%27s_sixbar/watt%27s_sixbar.htm" target="_parent">Watt's 
        six-bar</a> linkage. Note that the sun gear and planet (in pink) gears 
        have the same size.</p>
