      <p align="left">As the pawl lever (in purple) with the driving pawl (in 
        green) is made to oscillate, the ratchet wheel (in blue) will rotate counterclockwise 
        with an intermittent motion. A holding pawl (in orange) prevents the ratchet 
        wheel from rotating backward when the pawl lever is rotated clockwise 
        in preparation for another stroke. This mechanism has many applications, 
        particularly in counting devices.</p>
