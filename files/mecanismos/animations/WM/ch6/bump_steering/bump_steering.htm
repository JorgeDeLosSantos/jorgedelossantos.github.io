      <p>An ill-fated rear suspension design tends to “bump steer,” i.e., turn 
      the rear axle when hitting a bump on one side of the car. The fourbar 
      linkage controls the up and down motion of one side of the rear axle and 
      one wheel. Ideally, the wheel should move up and down in a straight 
      vertical line when hitting a bump. As shown in the simulation, when one 
      wheel has hit a bump,&nbsp; the center of the wheel moves forward as it 
      moves up over the bump. This forward motion turns the axle and steers the 
      car unintentionaly.&nbsp; </p>
